# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The project contains 4 pages. The main page is index.html, which gives an overview of 3 different bikes that I'm considering to buy. The page contains the two list types and a link (displaying an image when hovering it) to the .html for each of the bikes. I have styled the page for each bike differently:

- konalibre.html: basic html, styled with .css (located in css/master.css), includes a table and an image. This page shares the style with index.html.
- divergecomp.html: styled using bootstrap 4, using cards to display the bike detail table and an image of the bike
- scottspeedster.html: styled using sass (the files are located in sass/style2.scss)

Additionally the images of the three bikes are given in the folder img.
